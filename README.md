# Tomestone

Web API server implementation of Lumina with AWS Docker based off of Adam's demo.

Some quick things:
* Requires the `ffxiv/0a*` files to be located in the datapath you provide
* Some things break, due to cyclic references
* The initial load of a sheet will be _slowish_ but subsequent loads will be very fast (< 1ms) as the data will be cached in memory from thereon
* Lumina is single threaded, normally this isn't a problem but you will need to warm up the row cache for each sheet if you want to avoid this problem when the api is under high load


# Usage
Hit `<api host>/sheets/{language}/{sheetName}/{rowId}[/{subRowId}}` and you get data back.

`subRowId` is optional and not required, only provide if you require it.
